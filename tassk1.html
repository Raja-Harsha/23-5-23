 <h3>   <p >William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. He is best 
    known for co-founding software giant Microsoft, along with his late childhood friend Paul Allen. During his career at 
    Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president and chief software architect, while 
    also being its largest individual shareholder until May 2014. He was a major entrepreneur of the microcomputer revolution of 
    the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
    <p>
        Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people.[13][14] From 1995 to 2017, he held the 
        Forbes title of the richest person in the world every year except from 2010 to 2013.[15] In October 2017, he was surpassed by 
        Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, who had an estimated net worth of US$90.6 billion compared to Gates's net worth of US$89.9 
        billion at the time.[16] As of March 2023, Gates has an estimated net worth of US$116 billion, making him the fourth-richest 
        person in the world according to Bloomberg News.[17]
    </p>
    <p>
        Later in his career and since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft in 2008, Gates has pursued many business and philanthropic 
        endeavors. He is the founder and chairman of several companies, including BEN, Cascade Investment, TerraPower, bgC3, and Breakthrough 
        Energy. He has given sizable amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill 
        & Melinda Gates Foundation, reported to be the world's largest private charity.[18] Through the foundation, he led an early 21st 
        century vaccination campaign that significantly contributed to the eradication of the wild poliovirus in Africa.[19][20] In 2010, 
        Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their 
        wealth to philanthropy.[21]

<h3><p>Bill Gates was born in Seattle, Washington on October 28, 1955. He is the son of William H. Gates Sr.(1925–2020) and Mary Maxwel
     Gates (1929–1994). His ancestry includes English, German, and Irish/Scots-Irish.[His father was a prominent lawyer, and his
      mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way of America. Gates's maternal grandfather
       was J. W. Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has an older sister Kristi (Kristianne) and a younger sister Libby. He is the 
       fourth of his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or "Trey" (i.e., three) because his father had the "II" suffix.
     The family lived in the Sand Point area of Seattle in a home that was damaged by a rare tornado when Gates was seven years old.
    </p>
    <p>
        At 13, he enrolled in the private Lakeside prep school, where he wrote his first software program. When he was in the 
        eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR 
        terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the students. Gates took an interest in 
        programming the GE system in BASIC, and he was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer 
        program on this machine, an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was 
        fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. After the Mothers Club donation was 
        exhausted, Gates and other students sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 
        belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC) which banned Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Gates's best friend and first 
        business partner Kent Evans, for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer 
        time.

    <img width="32%" align="right"src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Altair_8800_Computer.jpg/1024px-Altair_8800_Computer.jpg" alt="">

    <p>
        Gates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics which demonstrated the Altair 8800, and he contacted Micro Instrumentation
         and Telemetry Systems (MITS) to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform.
         In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's 
         interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over the course of a few weeks they developed 
         an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration was held at MITS's offices in 
         Albuquerque, New Mexico; it was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. MITS 
         hired Allen,[55] and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with him at MITS in November 1975. Allen named their 
         partnership "Micro-Soft", a combination of "microcomputer" and "software", and their first office was in Albuquerque. The 
         first employee Gates and Allen hired was their high school collaborator Ric Weiland.[55] They dropped the hyphen within a year 
         and officially registered the trade name "Microsoft" with the Secretary of the State of New Mexico on November 26, 1976. Gates 
         never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked out and was 
        being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, he wrote an Open Letter to Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in which he 
        asserted that more than 90% of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and the Altair "hobby market" 
        was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality 
        software.[56] This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers 
        should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming 
        language software for various systems.[55] The company moved from Albuquerque to Bellevue, Washington on January 1, 1979.[54]

    <p>
        IBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time, approached Microsoft in July 1980 
        concerning software for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC,[60] after Bill Gates's mother, Mary Maxwell Gates, mentioned 
        Microsoft to John Opel, IBM's CEO.[61] IBM first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. IBM's representatives also 
        mentioned that they needed an operating system, and Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the widely used CP/M 
        operating system.[62] IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, however, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. 
        IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and asked if Microsoft 
        could provide an operating system. A few weeks later, Gates and Allen proposed using 86-DOS, an operating system similar to CP/M, 
        that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC.[63] Microsoft made a deal with SCP to 
        be the exclusive licensing agent of 86-DOS, and later the full owner. Microsoft employed Paterson to adapt the operating system for 
        the PC[64] and delivered it to IBM as PC DOS for a one-time fee of $50,000.[65]
    </p>
    <p>
        The contract itself only earned Microsoft a relatively small fee. It was the prestige brought to Microsoft by IBM's adoption of 
        their operating system that would be the origin of Microsoft's transformation from a small business to the leading software company 
        in the world. Gates had not offered to transfer the copyright on the operating system to IBM because he believed that other 
        personal computer makers would clone IBM's PC hardware.[65] They did, making the IBM-compatible PC, running DOS, a de facto 
        standard. The sales of MS-DOS (the version of DOS sold to customers other than IBM) made Microsoft a major player in the industry.
        [66] The press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the IBM PC. PC Magazine asked if Gates was "the man behind 
        the machine?".[60]

    <p>
        Microsoft and Gates launched their first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985, in an attempt to fend off 
        competition from Apple's Macintosh GUI, which had captivated consumers with its simplicity and ease of use.[69] In August of 
        the following year, the company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although the two 
        companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative 
        differences.[70] The operating system grew out of DOS in an organic fashion over a decade until Windows 95, which hid the DOS 
        prompt by default. Windows XP, released one year after Gates stepped down as Microsoft CEO, was the first to not be based on DOS.
        [71] Windows 8.1 was the last version of the OS released before Gates left the chair of the firm to John W. Thompson on February 
        5, 2014.[72]
